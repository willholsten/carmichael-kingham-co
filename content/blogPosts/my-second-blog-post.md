Please allow us to properly introduce Carmichael Kingham & Co. In September 2018 Annabelle Carmichael and Alasdair Kingham joined forces to establish Carmichael Kingham and Co. - a modern accountancy practice specialising in helping businesses grow. We love being part of our client’s journeys and we love seeing our clients improve profitability, cash flow and gain control over their finances. We use technology wherever possible in order to automate repetitive tasks so that we can focus on providing support to our clients. We believe that the best way that we can help businesses grow is by ensuring they have up-to-date financial information on a regular basis. This includes but is by no means limited to providing quarterly or monthly management accounts, budgets, forecasts and analysis on your business. On top of that we take care of all your traditional accountancy needs including bookkeeping, payroll and tax. We believe in strong relationships with our clients so for that reason we bill monthly and encourage our clients to speak to us on a regular basis. That way we sort the small stuff before it becomes big stuff and clients don’t end up with an unexpected accountancy bill at the end of the year. If you’re struggling to stay on top of your paperwork and need some help with the bookkeeping and accountancy side of your business please reach out to us, we’re always happy to have a free no-obligation chat about how we can help your business achieve its goals!
