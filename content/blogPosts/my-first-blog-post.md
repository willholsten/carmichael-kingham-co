What a fantastic couple of days! This year we attended our first Xerocon and we were not disappointed! We’d attended Xero Roadshows and collaborative days before however it’s probably fair to say you haven’t had the full Xero experience until you’ve attended Xerocon. As a practice we've embraced cloud accountancy and the efficiencies that come with the cloud however with over 700 apps integrating with Xero the cloud accountancy space can appear somewhat overwhelming. We met with technology providers who demonstrated their software allowing us to fully comprehend the functionality provided by each by each application. 

We kicked off the day with Xero coffee (a fairly normal way to start the day) and ended with fun at the Xerocon Party. During the day we visited vendors in the hall (over 70 vendors were present) and attended presentations by industry leaders. Xero provided a live agenda to download which made choosing stages easier, it was like deciding between bands at a music festival only harder! Highlights include meeting leading technology providers, learning about Xero’s new releases and listening to Tim Peake's fascinating experiences as an astronaut. We can’t wait for Xerocon 2020! 


If you're thinking about adopting cloud accounting software and you don't know where to start, or you have already migrated to the cloud but feel overwhelmed by the sheer choice in providers, reach out to us and we can help you achieve process efficiencies and superior reporting.
