  What a fantastic couple of days! This year we attended our first Xerocon and
  we were not disappointed! We’d attended Xero Roadshows and collaborative days

What a fantastic couple of days! This year we attended our first Xerocon and we were not disappointed! We’d attended Xero Roadshows and collaborative days before however it’s probably fair to say you haven’t had the full Xero experience until you’ve attended Xerocon. We kicked off the day with coffee (a fairly normal way to start the day) and ended with dancing, drinks and fun at the Xerocon Party. Between the hours of coffee and wine we made our way to every vendor in the hall which was a fantastic way to see the technology providers that are leading the accounting industry. Xero provided a fantastic live agenda to download which made choosing stages easier, it was like deciding between bands at a music festival only harder! Highlights would have to include seeing Tim Peake live and hearing about his fascinating experiences as an astronaut, meeting technology providers who are changing the accountancy industry and learning about the new releases that Xero is rolling out. We can’t wait for Xerocon 2020!
