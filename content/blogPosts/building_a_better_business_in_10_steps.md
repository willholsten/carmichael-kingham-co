You’re in business, congratulations, that takes courage and commitment.

It’s not easy, and at times you might find yourself questioning why you’re even doing it, but you’re here because you had a vision. You decided being in business was a better way to achieve that vision than working for someone else. And, you’re right; you just have to work on it. Good things come to people who hustle.

You’re likely an expert in what you do… maybe you’re a mechanic and know the inside of a car engine like the back of your hand. Or, maybe you’re a fashion retailer who can style anyone. This doesn’t mean you’re an expert at running your business though. It’s hard taking time out of working *in* your business to work *on* it. But doing this is essential for its success.

There’s no magical overnight solution to building a more successful business. It’s about taking small steps every day to get a bit better than the day before.

1. Get clear on exactly what it is that you want.
2. Take every opportunity to learn.
3. Be open to change. 
4. Define where you are now (don't leave out those pain points). 
5. Make a plan.
6. Make small changes everyday. 
7. Be held accountable by someone independent.
8. Build strong networks.
9. Monitor your progress.
10. Keep your well of happiness full.
